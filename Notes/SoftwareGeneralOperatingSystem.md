# NOTES: Software GENERAL Operating System (OS)

Installed Operating System, e.g. Windows, Linux Ubuntu,<br/>
--> uses: as identification both Motherboard with Harddisk Storage (with installed OS),<br/>
--> adds: remaining parts are changeable without need to re-install OS,<br/>
--> where: remaining parts include among others:<br/> 
--> Graphics Acceleration Card, Random Access Memory (RAM)

### Reminder based on understanding

Change of Motherboard and/or Harddisk Storage (with installed OS),<br/>
--> causes: re-installation of OS (with new OS license if applicable)

#### Additional Notes: Windows OS

> As long as the license is retail you can move it wherever you want.

--> No need to buy a new license.<br/>
--> <b>Example Retail Store:</b> Gadget King @Sta. Lucia East Grand Mall

> If it was factory installed OEM then you'll need to buy a new license. 

--> <b>Example:</b> laptop with pre-installed license

#### Additional Reminders

1) > Deeply discounted keys are almost always bogus and will not last. 

--> adds: "There are no deep discounts in retail Windows 10." 

2) > The serial number of your motherboard is linked to your Windows 10 Digital Licence 

--> During OS re-installation, no need to enter a Product Key <br/>
--> due to: Microsoft already knows the serial number of the motherboard
